This is my first React and Next.js project — a simple Todo App.

I created this project to practice React and get hands-on experience with Next.js. It's also the first time I used Tailwind CSS in a project.

The design is not so good, as my main focus was learning React rather than perfecting the UI.
Through this project, I learned how to use the useState hook, JSX Syntax, Props and State Basics – Passing data and managing internal state, 
Event Handling, Conditional Rendering, Lists and Keys, Rendering dynamic lists and using key props and gained a basic understanding of how React works.
